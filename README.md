Machine-Learning-Practical-Task
===============================

Using logistic regression on the training and test data provided to predict if users will default on bank loans, implemented in python. 

The implemented code produced an entry for a copy of the kaggle competition www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit, which was restricted to Oxford University members.

In this project, I was provided with instructions (Which can be found in "Machine-Learning-Practical-Task/Practical Instructions"), data (in the "Machine-Learning-Practical-Task/data" folder), and the base source code (found in "Machine-Learning-Practical-Task/originalSrc".

I produced the code listed in src.

Note that in order to run either program, the data directory should be copied into either src or originalSrc.
